<h3 id="what-kinds-of-diagrams-can-i-create-with-southbeach-modeller-">What kinds of diagrams can I create with Southbeach Modeller?</h3>
<p>Southbeach Notation was conceived by distilling common features across various business and engineering diagrams, particularly those focused on innovation and problem-solving. It empowers users to craft broad conceptual, functional, or process maps without becoming mired in minutiae. And go straight on to generate ideas.</p>
<p>Although Southbeach Modeller may not mirror the aesthetic of mainstream diagrams, its designs introduce a refreshing visual angle. Rather than emulating established styles, it provides a unified notation and a creative engine that resonates with the essence of conventional diagrams. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>9boxes</li>
<li>Affinity diagram</li>
<li>Argument map</li>

<h2 id="southbeach-notation">Southbeach Notation</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-southbeach-notation-">What is Southbeach Notation?</h3>
<p>Southbeach Notation provides a rich visual-thinking platform, adept at articulating intricate situations, problems, challenges and opportunities. Unlike freeform diagrams or mind maps, each model maintains a consistent approach and interpretation. At its core, Southbeach Notation revolves around the concepts of useful and harmful functions, as well as increasing and decreasing influences. While Southbeach is straightforward enough to sketch manually, it possesses the depth to accommodate the most rigorous projects.</p>
<p>Southbeach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Captures agreement as well as disagreement.</li>
<li>Fosters communication among team members. (Marketing and engineering can speak the same language.)</li>
<li>Conveys intricate challenges and solutions effectively. </li>
<li>Enhances mutual understanding. Deepens insights into customer needs. Foster collaboration, whether internal or external.</li>
<li>Applies in technical, non-technical, engineering, business and scientific domains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Southbeach diagrams chart a path from the current state (&#39;as is&#39;) to the desired future state (&#39;to be&#39;) across:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product innovation</li>
<li>Service innovation</li>
<li>Systems design</li>
<li>Business process</li>
<li>Enterprise architecture</li>
<li>Organizational change</li>
<li>Strategy and planning</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="southbeach-platform">Southbeach Platform</h2>
<h3 id="what-platform-s-does-southbeach-modeller-support-">What platform(s) does Southbeach Modeller support?</h3>
<p>Southbeach Modeller is a professional .NET application designed for Windows 11 and 10, embodying the Southbeach Notation. For Apple users, the software operates seamlessly with Parallels Desktop for Mac or VMWare Fusion. The visual models, and all ideation output and reports generated, are stored in .sbm format, an XML format. </p>
<p>The software is built upon an advanced, adaptable graphics engine from a reputable third-party provider, delivering top-tier auto layout functionalities (Freeform, Tree and Graph). Modeller incorporates an integrated ideation engine, MyCreativity, which operates analogously to a rules engine or macro processor. </p>
<p>The software is optimized for touch screens, inclusive of interactive whiteboards. Upcoming versions will enhance touch gesture support for Windows tablets. </p>
<h3 id="what-is-southbeach-mycreativity-">What is Southbeach MyCreativity?</h3>
<p>MyCreativity is a brand name for the rules engine inside Southbeach Modeller. It understands the Southbeach Notation object types, effects, modifiers, attributes and tags and can recognise user- or developer-supplied patterns in any Southbeach Model. Rules are organised into rulesets and named in a hierarchy. Rules define contextual sentences (stated in any human language) that are output when patterns match objects and effects in a visual model. As the user clicks around, or edits, the model, ideation is generated within a defined &#39;extent&#39; (number of hops in the model). </p>
<p>MyCreativity is also the basis for the reporting and cues (combinatorial ideation) capabilities of Southbeach Modeller.</p>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<h3 id="do-i-need-a-license-to-use-southbeach-modeller-">Do I need a license to use Southbeach Modeller?</h3>
<p>Yes. We offer a 30-day free, full function, trial, after which a license is required. Please visit our shop at <a href="https://www.southbeachinc.com/shop.html">https://www.southbeachinc.com/shop.html</a></p>
<p>Discounts are available for multiple computers, students and academics, as well as the needs of training companies. Write to us for details at <strong> orders@southbeachinc.com </strong></p>
<h3 id="is-southbeach-modeller-open-source-software-">Is Southbeach Modeller open source software?</h3>
<p>No. The software itself is proprietary. However, the &#39;content&#39; delivered with Southbeach Modeller is open source (CC BY-SA 4.0). This includes the extensive tag library, creativity library/rulesets, the grid/chart definitions, resource lists and cue definitions. </p>
<p>The license requires that reusers give credit to the creator. It allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, even for commercial purposes. If others remix, adapt, or build upon the material, they must license the modified material under identical terms.</p>
<p>The same license applies to the definition of the Southbeach Notation itself. Southbeach Modeller from Southbeach Solutions Ltd, is the reference implementation of Southbeach Notation. The originators of the notation, Howard Smith and Mark Burnett, encourage further implementations.</p>
<p>New implementations of Southbeach Notation could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile applications; Southbeach apps;</li>
<li>Templated shapes and arrows for use within an existing drawing package (desktop or web-based);</li>
<li>A Southbeach module incorporated within an existing, customizable, modelling tool;</li>
<li>A next generation enterprise innovation management application.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="triz">TRIZ</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-relationship-of-southbeach-to-triz-">What is the relationship of Southbeach to TRIZ?</h3>
<p>Southbeach was inspired by TRIZ, the Russian theory of Inventive Problem Solving. We created Southbeach Notation to unifiy diagram conventions from TRIZ, business consulting, business process and engineering, to facilitate systematic problem-solving and idea generation.</p>
<p>Southbeach Modeller is a favored tool among TRIZ practitioners. Before the advent of Southbeach Notation, there wasn&#39;t a universally accepted diagrammatic style for TRIZ. Southbeach Solutions stepped in to fill that gap.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re well-versed in TRIZ but feel Southbeach doesn&#39;t cater to your needs, write to <strong> feedback@southbeachinc.com. </strong></p>
