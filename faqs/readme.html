<h2 id="q6-specifically-what-methods-does-southbeach-support-">Q6: Specifically, what &#39;methods&#39; does Southbeach support?</h2>
<p>Southbeach was developed by studying 100s of creativity techniques, problem-solving methods, and associated diagrammatic conventions. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>5Whys</li>
<li>7Questions</li>
<li>8Ds</li>
<li>Affinity</li>
<li>Backcasting</li>
<li>Before&amp;after</li>
<li>Blue ocean</li>
<li>Boston Matrix</li>
<li>BSC</li>
<li>Cause/effect</li>
<li>DfSS</li>
<li>Futures</li>
<li>Horizons</li>
<li>KANO</li>
<li>Lean</li>
<li>PEST</li>

<p>Using a single &#39;unified&#39; visual style (Southbeach Notation), the software can depict the essential characteristics of many well-known diagrams. The advantage of this over a general-purpose &#39;drawing package&#39; is that every Southbeach model has a well-defined meaning (semantic). Furthermore, the rules engine included in Southbeach (MyCreativity) can generate &#39;directions&#39; (new intellectual property, ideas, reports) from any Southbeach model.</p>

<h2 id="q7-how-does-the-rule-engine-work-">Q7: How does the rule engine work?</h2>
<p>Modeller comes bundled with 100s of carefully curated ideation scripts and rulesets. However, using any text editor, users can write their own rulesets or copy and adapt existing rulesets. A quickguide and user manual explains the rules language.</p>
<ul>
<li>Southbeach visual modeller contains an embedded rules engine</li>
<li>The user writes rules that generate creative suggestions from any model</li>
<li>Rules can be reused across any visual model, in any field of analysis</li>
<li>Suggestions generated support the users&#39; creative thinking and problem solving</li>
<li>A rule is a pattern plus a sentence containing expandable macros</li>
<li>Sentences can have embedded newlines to generate paragraphs</li>
<li>Patterns and macros are formed using keywords from the Southbeach notation</li>
<li>Every agent or effect attribute in the notation is supported by the engine</li>
<li>Patterns and macros can also match any user supplied text in the model</li>
<li>User text is any agent name, effect name or label, tag or grid position on the canvas</li>
<li>A ruleset is a group of such rules intended to support the intent of the analyst</li>
<li>Rulesets can be named and organized into a hierarchy for easy access</li>
<li>Users turn on and off rulesets as they work through an analysis</li>
<li>As the user clicks around a model, rules are matched to the model content</li>
<li>Rules trigger within a defined extent / scope, set by the user at run time</li>
<li>Where a pattern matches the model within the extent, sentences are output</li>
<li>Macros embedded in the sentences are expanded as they are generated</li>
<li>Creative suggestions (ideas) are listed in creativity panels within the application</li>
<li>Ideas generated are saved with the model in panel in which they are generated</li>
<li>Model-specific rules can also be embedded in the creativity panels</li>
<li>Model-specific rules can be turned on or off by the user at run time</li>
<li>In addition to the interactive mode, reports can also be generated</li>
<li>A report is a template containing embedded rules and reporting instructions</li>
<li>After any change to a model, reports can be re-generated and updated</li>
<li>Reports extend the pattern language to allow for the processing of indirect effects</li>
<li>Reports contain formatting instructions for bulleted, numbered and lettered lists</li>
<li>Reports can be run over one or all models of a model file set</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="q7-why-the-odd-name-">Q7: Why the odd name?</h2>
<p>Despite the creators of Southbeach being British, the early ideas for the notation were first drawn in the sand on South Beach, Miami, Florida, in June 2005.</p>
